# ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ Figma UI/UX Design Essentials  
 **Topic:** Icons, Plugins, Wireframes  
**Class Project 04 :** Mobile Prototyping & Testing (Submitted âœ…) 
---

## Project Overview

This project, "Class Project 04: Testing on your phone using prototyping," focuses on demonstrating key aspects of UI/UX prototyping using Figma. The primary goal was to learn and apply various prototyping techniques, including animations, easing, and the crucial step of testing prototypes directly on a mobile device using Figma Mirror.
---


In this module, I gained practical experience and a deeper understanding of:

* **How to Prototype in Figma:** Creating interactive flows, linking screens, and defining user journeys.
* **Prototype Animation & Easing in Figma:** Implementing various animation types and understanding how easing functions impact the feel and smoothness of transitions.
* **Testing on Your Phone with Figma Mirror:** The invaluable process of testing prototypes on actual mobile devices to gain real-world feedback and identify usability issues. This helped in understanding the user experience from a mobile-first perspective.
